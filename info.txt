•   Methods of obtaining isotopes :

1. Nuclear Reactors:
   – Nuclear reactors can produce isotopes through neutron activation. This method is often used to create stable isotopes for agricultural research, such as nitrogen-15 for studying nitrogen fixation in plants.

1. Field Experiments with Isotopes:

   – Controlled field experiments using isotopes help in understanding plant growth, nutrient absorption, and the effects of fertilizers. These experiments often utilize isotopes like nitrogen-15.

1. Nuclear Reactors:
   – How it Happens: Nuclear reactors produce isotopes through a process called neutron activation. In this method, stable isotopes in a target material (like nitrogen) are bombarded with neutrons. This interaction can convert stable isotopes into radioactive isotopes or change their properties. For example, nitrogen-14 can be transformed into nitrogen-15.
   – Application: Nitrogen-15 is particularly valuable in agricultural research for studying nitrogen fixation in plants, helping scientists understand how plants absorb nitrogen from the soil and the atmosphere.

2. Cyclotrons:
   – How it Happens: Cyclotrons accelerate charged particles (like protons) to high speeds and direct them onto a target material. When these particles collide with the target, nuclear reactions occur that can produce various isotopes. For instance, carbon-14 is produced when nitrogen-14 captures a neutron and undergoes beta decay.
   – Application: Carbon-14 is used in tracing carbon dynamics in ecosystems, allowing researchers to study carbon cycling in soil and plant systems,
