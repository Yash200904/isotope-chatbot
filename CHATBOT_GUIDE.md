❓ 3. Ask a Question - Get expert answers

Just type your choice (1, 2, 3) or ask me anything about isotopes!
```

### **Quiz Flow Example**
```
Great choice! 🧠 Let's test your isotope knowledge with a quick quiz.

Question 1/5: Which isotope is most commonly used in medical imaging?
A) Iodine-131
B) Technetium-99m  
C) Cobalt-60
D) Carbon-14

[After completion]
🎉 Quiz Complete! Your Score: 4/5 (80%)

Excellent work! You demonstrated strong knowledge in:
✅ Medical isotope applications
✅ Safety protocols

Areas for improvement:
📚 Industrial process applications

Would you like to ask anything else about these topics?
```

### **Game Flow Example**
```
Time for some fun! 🎮 Let's play "Isotope Detective"

I'm thinking of an isotope used in cancer treatment. It has a half-life of about 8 days and is often used in thyroid therapy.

Can you guess which isotope I'm thinking of?
Hint: It starts with "I" and ends with "131"

[After game completion]
That was fun! 😄 You correctly identified Iodine-131! 

Do you have any questions about non-energy isotopes or their applications?
